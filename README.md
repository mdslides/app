**Goal Oriented.**
MdSlides is designed to focus on the content rather than moving text blocks back and forth.

**Mobile First.**
The device used does not affect the process of creating presentations, nor the final result.

**Installable.**
Even though it is a web application, it can be used offline or even installed.

**Accessible.**
MdSlides requires no extra interaction other than writing down one's thoughts.

**Secure.**
Processing data is not stored in the application, but in the one's device/browser only.

**Open Source.**
The application development is community-driven. Contributions are welcome.
